# Excel-Sheet-Data-Reorganization
-repeating and reorganizing data on Excel Sheets manually is very tedious

-wrote a C++ program to repeat every data on an Excel sheet a certain number of times and another one to move all of the data into one column

-reduced the workload for 570 cells of data from 5 hours to 30 minutes 

-written and tested in Visual Studios
